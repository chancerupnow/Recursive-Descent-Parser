Inside program():
    for each CAL instruction in code
        set the M value of the instruction to the address of the procedure

    ** this for loop I'm totally lost on **
    ## loop through code
        ## if code is CAL
            ## set instruction m val to table address using code m val as index

    since we now know main's address, we can fix that initial jump

    ** how am i fixing jump here and how am I getting main's address? **
    ## set first code m val to first table val address

    emit HLT

    ** what am I passing as m value? **
    ## emit(SYS, 0, HLT);

Inside block():
    once we emit INC, we'll be emitting code so this is where the procedure starts,
    multiply the address by 3 bc PAS format

    ** am I multiplying inc_m_value * 3 here? **
    ## multiply procedures address idfk just do what ta says

Inside procedures():
    emit RTN

    ** what am I passing as m value? **
    ## emit(OPR, 0, RTN);

Inside statement():
    emit RED

    ** what am I passing as m value? **
    ## emit(SYS, 0, RED);
